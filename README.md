# Milon Hapashut

This is a free Hebrew-English & English-Hebrew dictionary.

The main goal was to make a completely offline dictionary, so it'd work without internet connection. The app loads and processes a huge amount of JSON data so it might be slow and laggy, especially on mobile devices.
So normally you may consider using online services like [Morfix](http://morfix.co.il/), while keeping this app for non-expected situations.

Note: if your Android web browser crashes every time you try to search a word, check out a new [Milon app for Android](https://github.com/chschtsch/milon-android/). It' slow too, but at least it's more optimized and shouldn't crash.
